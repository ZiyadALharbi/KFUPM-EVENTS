# KFUPM Event Registration Platform

## Overview

Our journey began with the need to unify the KFUPM community's event registration process. Existing methods were fragmented and inefficient, leading to scattered, poorly promoted events. Previous corporate solutions were costly and inadequate for our needs. We developed an in-house platform tailored specifically to KFUPM, streamlining event registration and management.

## Features

- **Centralized Event Registration**: Simplifies the process for students, faculty, and organizers.
- **Increased Event Visibility**: Helps users easily discover and register for events.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design ensures a positive experience.
- **Data Security**: Hosted on MongoDB servers for robust user data protection.
- **WhatsApp Messaging**: Enhances communication between organizers and participants.

## Technology Stack

- **Front-end**:Bootstrap 5, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-end**: Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Development Strategy

We divided tasks among team members, assigning roles for both front-end and back-end development to ensure focused and steady progress.

## Unique Aspects

- **Tailored for KFUPM**: Specifically designed to meet the unique needs of the KFUPM community.
- **Innovative Features**: Includes WhatsApp messaging for enhanced engagement.

## Limitations

- **No Dark Mode**: Currently lacks an alternative interface for improved readability.
- **Integration Challenges**: Technical and logistical issues prevented seamless integration with the KFUPM Portal.
- **Event Submission Constraints**: Resource constraints and quality concerns limited the implementation of student-submitted events.

Despite these limitations, our platform represents a significant step towards enhancing event experiences at KFUPM. We are committed to continuous improvement and innovation.
